Hi! 

.exe can be found in "MAPS/build/bin/"

log files should always be called "Movementlog.txt" and or "BatteryLog.txt"

to create new movement files log data in to a file with x and y on separate lines one after another I.Ei "X /n Y /n"

BP can be used to rebuild the visual studios solution

if the .exe doesn't work try rebuilding the project with BP.bat

both logs should always be kept in logs

Video of the .exe building and runnning can be found in the MAPS folder called "Analytics Video"
